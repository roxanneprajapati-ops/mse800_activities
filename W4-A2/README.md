# Brief Scenario

This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)–based clinic management system developed using Python and SQLite. The system is designed to support clinic operations by allowing clinic staff to manage patient records, doctor information, and appointment scheduling.

The system enables clinic staff to insert and store records for patients, doctors, and appointments. It also provides reporting features to list all senior patients aged over 65 and to count the total number of doctors specialising in ophthalmology.
