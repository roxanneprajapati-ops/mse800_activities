This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation of a simplified college course management system.
It is based on the database design from W3-A3 and demonstrates how OOP concepts can be used to model students, teachers, and courses.

The program fulfills two main requirements:
1. Show the total number of students enrolled in the MSE800 course.
2. List all teacher names who are teaching the MSE801 course.

The system uses Python classes to represent the main parts of the system and how they are connected. SQLite is used to store the data so it can be saved and used again later.
