# Week 5 Activity 7 - Debugging
# Author: Roxanne Prajapati
# Explanation:
#      The main program raised an AttributeError because of
#      line 66 (print(s1.__age)). The attribute __age is private
#      to the Person class, which means it cannot be accessed
#      directly outside that class, including from a subclass
#      or the main program.
#
#      The issue can be fixed by accessing the value through
#      the public getter method get_age().

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, address, age):
        # Public attribute
        self.name = name

        # Protected attribute (subclasses can access)
        self._address = address

        # Private attribute (class-only)
        self.__age = age

    # Public method
    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}")

    # Public getter for private attribute
    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age


class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, address, age, student_id):
        super().__init__(name, address, age)

        # Private attribute (Student only)
        self.__student_id = student_id

    # Public method accessing protected attribute
    def show_address(self):
        print(f"Address: {self._address}")

    # Public getter
    def get_student_id(self):
        return self.__student_id

    # Overriding public method
    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hi, I'm {self.name} and I'm a student!")



if __name__ == "__main__":
    s1 = Student("Alice", "123 Main St", 20, "S12345")

    # Public access
    print(s1.name)

    # Protected access (allowed but discouraged outside class)
    print(s1._address)

    # Fix the error by calling the public getter method get_age()
    print(s1.get_age())

    # Correct way to access private data
    print("Age:", s1.get_age())
    print("Student ID:", s1.get_student_id())

    s1.greet()
